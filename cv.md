### About me

***

Now I am just in process of finding my path in live, so I am searching for new expirience. For some time I was writing texts, translate comics, making posters for events. Then once I tried to make my own site, and now it is what I want to do, and do it well. I like working in web, combining design with coding. Hope, that my future work will be very interesting!
